# RNA-Seq-workflow-Differential-Expression

This is an adaptation of Charlotte Soneson's RNA-Seq teaching material, originally given at the EBI in April 2019.

Huge thanks to Charlotte for letting me (us) use that material and adapt it further.

The original material from Charlotte is available in the `doc` folder and is based on material from Mike Love, see [F1000Research](http://f1000research.com/articles/4-1070) and the more recent Bioconductor [workflow](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.12/workflows/html/rnaseqGene.html).
